# Airline Delay Prediction using Classification Algorithms

### Problem Description

The number of flights is growing as civil aviation develops, and flight delays are becoming a severe problem that even threatens to become the new normal. In particular, this work intends to demonstrate that the classification algorithm has advantages in the problem of algorithm selection in machine learning technology. The four supervised machine learning algorithms are KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

### Analysis Summary

Different days of the week and months have different average arrival delays. July has the highest average arrival delay on the contrary month November, September, and February have the negative average arrival delay. August has an average arrival delay of 20 minutes. January and December have an average arrival delay of 10 minutes. March, June, and October have an average arrival delay of less than 10 minutes. Day 7 has the highest average arrival delay on the contrary Day five has a negative average arrival delay. Day 6 and Day 1 have an average arrival delay of 10 minutes. Large distance Origin has less arrival delay as compared to Less distance Origin. The interval of 0-1000 distance has more high arrival data points than 1000-2000 distance data points.

As a result, classification accuracy intuitions based on balanced class distributions will be used incorrectly, deceiving the practitioner into believing that a model performs well or even well when it actually does not. There is no "most superior algorithm" or "most flexible method" in classification machine learning. Different algorithms must be tested. \`\`\`
