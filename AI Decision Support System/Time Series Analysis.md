#### Time Series Analysis



To predict soft drink production, Simple linear regression on the test dataset has achieved the lowest RMSE. We 
have also done some differencing in order to get the stationary time series data. In both cases, first-order 
differencing has enabled us to get the desired stationary data.
To confirm the stationarity in our data we have conducted an augmented dickey fuller test. In our second 
dataset of shoe sales simple Exponential Smoothing with default parameters has achieved the lowest RMSE 
on the contrary Holt Winterâ€™s Model has achieved the highest RMSE. We can select other advanced methods 
to achieve the desired accuracy and advanced performance evaluation metrics to select the best model 
to achieve the minimum uncertainty in prediction. We can also add some more crucial relevant data to 
achieve highly accurate predictions
